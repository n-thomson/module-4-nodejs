1. What is a Node module?
It is a set of functions that you want to include in your application.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
`module.exports` is what gets returns when we call require function. It returns an empty object by default, but we can assign it
anything. `exports` references `module.exports`. Assigning a new value to `exports` does not cause reassignment of `module.exports`.
We use `module.exports` when we want the module to be of specific object type.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
Reassigning `exports` doesn't impact `module.exports` and it is not available outside of the module.
